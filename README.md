## Recommendations

I will advise BMO to offer accounting services and products tailored to medium and small businesses. These services would include automated payroll and accounting management services. This will provide an additional source of income for BMO and as well give the businesses access to personalized automated payroll and accounting management option.

Since not many banks provide automated payroll, this can give BMO Financial group leverage compared to other competitors. Instead of them going elsewhere to source accounting and payroll needs, they can go to BMO. BMO can act as a one stop for all their financial business needs. With providing financial services, it can provide tailored automated payroll options to businesses and as well provide accounting management options to businesses.

BMO will need a software where businesses can access and input their payroll and accounting information. In addition it will need a dedicated team for accounting management to provide tailored services to these small to medium businesses. They can act as advisor as well for accounting needs.
